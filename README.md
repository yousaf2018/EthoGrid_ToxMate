**EthoGrid_ToxMate** is a specialized, high-performance desktop application engineered for researchers working with large-volume behavioral data, such as 24-hour recordings from automated systems like **ToxMate**. It provides a massively accelerated, end-to-end workflow to take you from raw, multi-hour videos to final in a fraction of the time.

Every stage of the EthoGrid_ToxMate pipeline is designed to be **transparent, customizable, and efficient**, giving you full scientific control over your high-throughput data.

## The EthoGrid_ToxMate Philosophy: Speed and Control for Big Data

Designed specifically to address the challenges of long-duration recordings, EthoGrid_ToxMate eliminates the bottlenecks of traditional analysis. It provides a single, unified platform optimized for speed:

1.  **High-Speed Video Preparation**: Automatically split massive 24-hour recordings into manageable 1-hour chunks with a single click, preserving original quality without slow re-encoding.
2.  **GPU-Accelerated AI Tracking**: Run high-performance YOLO models using an optimized process that maximizes GPU utilization, generating tracking data at high speeds.
3.  **Rapid Annotation & Cleaning**: Interactively align a virtual grid to your experimental setup once, then apply it to hundreds of video segments automatically in a powerful batch processing workflow.

## Key Features

-   **Optimized for High-Throughput**: Every module, from video splitting to annotated videos, is designed to work in batch mode on large numbers of files, saving countless hours of manual work.
-   **High-Performance Processing**:
    -   **YOLO Inference**: Automatically detects and utilizes NVIDIA GPUs for massive speed improvements, with a graceful fallback to CPU.
    -   **Video Resizing**: Leverages NVIDIA GPU hardware acceleration (`h264_nvenc`) for extremely fast video downscaling.
-   **Interactive Grid System**:
    -   Define a virtual grid and interactively translate, rotate, and scale it for perfect alignment.
    -   **Settings Persistence**: Save and load complex grid configurations to a JSON file, ensuring reproducibility.
-   **Advanced Batch Processing & Data Cleaning**:
    -   Apply a saved grid configuration to entire datasets automatically.
    -   Filter detections within each tank to keep only the highest-confidence animal per frame.
-   **Comprehensive Data Export**:
    -   Generate annotated videos, trajectory plots, heatmaps, and multiple data formats (`.csv`, `.xlsx`).

## Standalone Utilities

-   **Video Splitter**: Optimized for splitting multi-hour recordings (e.g., 24-hour ToxMate videos) into manageable chunks without quality loss.
-   **Frame Extractor**: A powerful tool for creating datasets by recursively finding all videos in a directory and extracting random, traceable frames.
-   **Video Quality Control**: A high-speed, GPU-accelerated tool to downscale large video files (e.g., 4K to 1080p), saving disk space and speeding up subsequent analysis.

## The Complete Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

This workflow demonstrates how to go from a raw video to a final statistical graph.

1.  **Prepare Video (Optional)**: Use the **✂️ Video Splitter** to cut a long recording into 1-hour segments.
2.  **Generate Tracking Data**: Use **🎨 Run YOLO Detection...** to run your trained model on the video segments. This produces a raw `_detections.csv` file for each.
3.  **Annotate Data**: In the main window, **🎬 Load** a sample video and the corresponding `_detections.csv`. Interactively create and align the grid, then **💾 Save Settings** to a `grid.json` file.
4.  **Batch Process**: Use **🚀 Batch Annotation...** to apply your saved `grid.json` to all your video segments and their `_detections.csv` files. This will generate the final, clean `_with_tanks.csv` files.
